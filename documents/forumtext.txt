Question: What happens when you put 16 developers in a room, deprive them of sleep and sanity and give them enough alcohol to fuel an army to invade Europe?

Answer: Well... I err... THIS.

A dark time has dawned for Conitec when the Torque community kidnaps Doug yet again.

In order to protect his identity, JCL dons the disguise of Zorrotto; A fearless crimefighter by night, developer by day. 
Unfortunately most of his clones are on assignment, so he only has limited tries before he has to give up. 
These are his adventures in dimension JCL-Zeta-Oscar-Romeo-Romeo-Oscar-PRINCEPERSIA.

Please note, that this is only the party release. Due to the short amount of time we had to skip a few things, which will hopefully be added for the contest release.
